Rom 9:7-9)." },
    { type: "mc", q: "Sarah’s laughter at the promise of a son (Gen 18:12–15) contrasts with Abraham’s earlier laughter (17:17) in that:", a: "Both are unbelief, but God graciously overcomes it", opts: ["Both are unbelief, but God graciously overcomes it","Hers stems from unbelief while his is joy","It shows gender differences in faith","Hers is forgiven, his is not"], expl: "Both instances reflect natural human incredulity at the impossible, yet God reaffirms the promise (Gen 17:17; 18:12-15)." },

    { type: "tf", q: "Esau’s despising of the birthright (Gen 25:29–34) is described in Hebrews 12:16 as godlessness/profanity – treating sacred covenant privileges as common.", a: true, expl: "True – Hebrews calls him “godless” for regarding spiritual blessing as worthless (Heb 12:16)." },
    { type: "mc", q: "Isaac’s reaffirmation of the Abrahamic blessing to Jacob (Gen 27:28–29; 28:3–4) despite deception shows:", a: "The irrevocability of God’s election and blessing once pronounced", opts: ["Rebekah’s manipulation succeeding over God’s will","The irrevocability of God’s election and blessing once pronounced","Isaac’s weakness","God’s approval of the means"], expl: "Once spoken, the blessing stands as God’s sovereign will (Gen 27:33)." },

    { type: "mc", q: "God’s promise to Jacob (Gen 28:13–15) – “I am with you and will keep you” – is most significant because:", a: "It is unconditional grace extended to a deceiver, showing covenant faithfulness despite human failure", opts: ["It guarantees immediate prosperity","It is unconditional grace extended to a deceiver, showing covenant faithfulness despite human failure","It replaces the promise to Abraham","It is conditional on Jacob’s obedience"], expl: "God pursues Jacob despite his character, demonstrating grace (Gen 28:15)." },
    { type: "tf", q: "Abraham’s intercession for Sodom demonstrates that God’s justice can be limited by human prayer.", a: false, expl: "False – God’s justice remains absolute; He is willing to spare for the sake of the righteous, but only up to His righteous standard." },
    { type: "tf", q: "The destruction of Sodom is presented solely as punishment for sexual sin.", a: false, expl: "False – Ezekiel 16:49-50 includes pride, excess, and neglect of the poor; sexual sin is part of a broader moral corruption." },
    { type: "tf", q: "Circumcision in Genesis 17 is primarily a sign of ethnic identity rather than covenant relationship.", a: false, expl: "False – It is the sign of the everlasting covenant between God and Abraham’s seed (Gen 17:11,13)." },

    { type: "tf", q: "Jacob’s vow at Bethel (Gen 28:20–22) shows perfect faith without conditions.", a: false, expl: "False – It is conditional ('if God will... then...'), reflecting immature but growing faith." },
    { type: "tf", q: "The reversal of Esau and Jacob reflects God’s consistent pattern of choosing the weak/younger to shame the strong.", a: true, expl: "True – This pattern recurs (Isaac over Ishmael, Jacob over Esau, Joseph over brothers, David over older brothers) and is cited in 1 Cor 1:27." },
    { type: "tf", q: "Lot is portrayed as fully righteous, making his rescue purely individualistic.", a: false, expl: "False – Lot is called righteous (2 Pet 2:7-8) but compromised; his rescue is tied to Abraham’s covenant standing (Gen 19:29)." },
    { type: "tf", q: "The Abrahamic covenant in Genesis 17 is bilateral and conditional in every aspect.", a: false, expl: "False – While circumcision is required, the core promises of land and seed are unilateral and unconditional." },

    { type: "tf", q: "Jacob’s name change to Israel is promised at Bethel but occurs later.", a: true, expl: "True – The promise is given in Gen 28:13-15; the actual renaming occurs in Gen 32:28 and is reaffirmed in Gen 35:10." },
    { type: "tf", q: "The patriarchal narratives in Genesis 19–28 ultimately point to God’s faithfulness despite human unfaithfulness.", a: true, expl: "True – Repeated human failure is met with unwavering divine covenant loyalty." }
